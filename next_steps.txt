What next steps should Netflix take in creating new shows/movies and adding existing shows/movies?

When creating new shows/movies and adding existing shows/movies, Netflix should focus more on movies than shows because movies are more popular. 

When creating new shows/movies, Netflix should hire the following directors, who are the top 5 directors based on the given data set:
1. Ra√∫l Campos, Jan Suter
2. Marcus Raboy
3. Jay Karas
4. Cathy Garcia-Molina
5. Jay Chapman

When adding existing shows/movies, Netflix should consider those released before 2000 because there currently aren't a lot of shows/movies released in that certain time period on Netflix. By adding them, Netflix will appeal to those who enjoy older shows/movies.
