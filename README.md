# Netflix Data Visualization
This model was created during Execute Big's Tech Roulette Week 3 and uses Python Pyplot.

## What is Data Visualization?
Data visualization is a powerful tool that can make complicated and large amounts of data appealing and understandable to non-technical people by portraying overall trends and patterns through graphs. 

## Goal
The overall goal is to determine what types of shows/movies Netflix should create. By answering the following smaller questions, I will be more informed and able to answer this overarching goal.

### Question 1: Who are the best directors?
This will help figure out who to hire as a director of the new show/movie.

### Question 2: Are shows or movies more popular?
This will determine the ratio of shows to movies Netflix should make.

### Question 3: What is the distribution of Netflix TV shows/movies over time by release date?
This can help determine if there's any shows/movies from certain time periods that Netflix may want to expand upon.
